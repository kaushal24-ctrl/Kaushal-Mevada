# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaushal Mevada — passionate about securing systems through effective detection, Digital forensics, and incident response. 🔐

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on **SOC analysis**, **digital forensics**, and **incident response**. I thrive at the intersection of technology and investigation — uncovering threats, analyzing digital trails, and responding with precision.

Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I actively explore the latest attack techniques, detection strategies, and defensive tools to stay ahead of evolving threats. Whether it's dissecting malicious payloads, correlating suspicious logs, or automating SOC workflows, I aim to make security smarter, faster, and more resilient.

I'm always open to knowledge-sharing, collaboration, and community-building in the cybersecurity space. Let's connect, build, and defend together!
